# Black Jack Simulator

For this assigment we were supposed to write a program that simulates the game of black jack between a user and the computer. I particularly liked this project because it was really fun to play once I had it working. For more details about the program refer to the *report.txt* file. 

## Rules of Black Jack

**GOAL:** Come as close to 21 as possible without going over
* If you exceed 21 you lose
* If the final value is less than 21 then the dealer takes cards up until 17 or higher
* Whoever has the higher value wins
* Aces are worth 11 points
* Face cards are worth 10 points
* All other cards are worth their number value (i.e. a 6 is worth 6 points)
* You can either hit (dealt another card) or stand (not dealt another card)

## Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/slancas1/smaller_assignments.git`
2. Run the Makefile: `make`
3. Run the executable: `./playblackjack`
4. Follow the instructions provided by the program
