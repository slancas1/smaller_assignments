## Crossword Generator

This was one of the most challenging assigments I had during my Fundamentals of Computing class. The assignment was to write a program that created a crossword puzzle from a set of given words. There were many conditions that the program had to account for including two words not being right next to each other, words not going off the board, etc. The solution to the puzzle as well as clues for solving the puzzle were also included in the final output of the program.
